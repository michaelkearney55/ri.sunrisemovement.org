                            <h4>Join the fight for climate justice and a Green New Deal in Rhode Island!</h4>
                            <p>We accomplished some amazing things in 2019 â€“ like organizing for the <span class='text-bold'>historic climate strikes</span> all over Rhode Island, hosting the <span class='text-bold'>Northeast Regional Sunrise Summit</span>, and getting Representative Cicilline to sign on to the <span class='text-bold'>Green New Deal</span>. This only happened because Rhode Islanders gave their time and money, signed petitions, recruited friends and family, and showed up at actions.</p>
                            <p>We need to <span class='text-bold'>keep the momentum going</span> as we head into the 2020 elections in order to win a Green New Deal for our state, create good jobs for all in Rhode Island, and defeat the climate crisis.</p>
