                            <p>The climate crisis is already happening right here in Rhode Island. Extreme weather events are growing more intense, shifting ocean conditions are affecting fishing stocks, and asthma rates from fossil fuel pollution are among the worst in the country. And across the board, it's indigenous people, people of color, and poor and working people who are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.</p>
                            <p>The youth of Rhode Island have had enough. The climate crisis is happening now, but it's young people who will face its worst effects. Sunrise is striking to demand a Green New Deal for Rhode Island that will create thousands of good jobs and ensure a livable future for all.</p>

                        <p>Governor Raimondo has taken over $500,000 from the fossil fuel industry. That includes a <a href='/assets/documents/schusterman.pdf' target='_blank'>single contribution of $250,000</a> from Stacy Schusterman, Chairwomen of Samson Energy, an oil and gas company. Raimondo also accepted a campaign contribution from the CEO and Founder of Invenergy, <span class='text-bold'>the company that tried to build the Burrillville Power Plant.</span> When our politicians rely on the fossil fuel industry to win their elections, we know that they won't have the people's best interests at heart when they take office.</p>

Late that evening, all fourteen of them were arrested and released just before midnight. Governor Raimondo has the power to stop this, but she continues to put the interests of fossil fuel executives and lobbyists above the interests of everyday Rhode Islanders.</span></p>
